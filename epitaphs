While this you read, the rising sigh
Demands a thought on death, as nigh
Why'far put off the solemn day
When you must molder in the clay
Life is a shadow, vapour dust
A rising bubble quickly burst
A fleeting wind, a passing breath
Mortal tis time to think of death


How loved, how valued once avails thee not
To whom related, or to whom begot
A heap of dust alone remains of thee
Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be


The die is cast, my hope, my fear
My pain, my joy, lies buried here
And reader you ere long must try
This dreaded change as well as I
Nor can a courteous ghost reveal
What I have felt and you must feel


Death is a debt to Nature due
Which I've paid & so must your


Is man more just than God? Is man more sure
Than he who deems e'en seraphs insecure?
Creatures of the day! Vain dwellers in the dust!
The moth survives you. And are ye more just?
Things of a day! You wither ere the night
Heedless and blind to wisdom's wasted light


Here in the silent grave I lie
No more the scenes of life to try
And you dear friends I leave behind
Must soon this gloomy mansion find


Where she's gone there's no distress
No sorrow intrerrupts her bliss
For while with us she here abode
We trust she gave her best to God


A Partner dear, a parent kind:
His body in the grave confined
Behold and see you that pass by
As I am now you soon must be
Therefore prepare to follow me


Hark from the tombs a doleful sound
My ears attend the cry
Ye living men come view the ground
where you must shortly lie


Princes this clay must be your bed
In spite of all your powers
The tall, the wise, the reverend head
Must lie as low as ours


Weep mpt for me, my pains are o'er
We soon shall meet to part no more


Behold the sad impending stroke
Which now arrests our eyes
The silken band of union broke
A tender mother dies


Draw near my friends and take a thought
How soon the grave must be your lot
Make sure of Christ while life remains
And death shall be your 'ternal gain
